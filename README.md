# Yahtzee-Game
Welcome to my Java-based implementation of the classic dice game, Yahtzee! This repository contains the source code and resources for a fully-featured Yahtzee game that can be played using the GUI I built. The game features intuitive gameplay, interactive dice rolling, and full support for all of the standard Yahtzee scoring categories. It also includes a pop-up feature that assists you in making the best decisions, using conditional probabilities and biniomial distribution.
